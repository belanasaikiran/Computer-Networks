    # Examples!
    # Create a host with a default route of the ethernet interface. You'll need to set the
    # default gateway like this for every host you make on this assignment to make sure all 
    # packets are sent out that port. Make sure to change the h# in the defaultRoute area
    # and the MAC address when you add more hosts!
    # h1 = self.addHost('h1',mac='00:00:00:00:00:01',ip='1.1.1.1/24', defaultRoute="h1-eth0")
    # h2 = self.addHost('h2',mac='00:00:00:00:00:02',ip='2.2.2.2/24', defaultRoute="h2-eth0")

    # Create a switch.
    # s1 = self.addSwitch('s1')

    # Connect Port 8 on the Switch to Port 0 on Host 1 and Port 9 on the Switch to Port 0 on 
    # Host 2. This is representing the physical port on the switch or host that you are 
    # connecting to.
    #
    # IMPORTANT NOTES: 
    # - On a single device, you can only use each port once! So, on s1, only 1 device can be
    #   plugged in to port 1, only one device can be plugged in to port 2, etc.
    # - On the "host" side of connections, you must make sure to always match the port you 
    #   set as the default route when you created the device above. Usually, this means you 
    #   should plug in to port 0 (since you set the default route to h#-eth0).
    #
    # self.addLink(s1,h1, port1=8, port2=0)
    # self.addLink(s1,h2, port1=9, port2=0)
